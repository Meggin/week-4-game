# Star Wars RPG

I learned a lot this week! Two main things I learned: pseudocode needs to go down to the lowest possible detail, and it's very important to refactor as you go. Don't wait towards later in the assignment.

I learned these two things the hard way, by not doing them and struggling!

As a result, I wound up with an application that I'm not super excited about. It's buggy. The attack button won't disable fully. I tried many ways to disable it, but I just couldn't figure it out. Refactoring along the way would have made this much easier.

Sometimes the score is a bit off. I suspect it's because a score goes below zero. If I had refactored earlier, I could have tested this properly.

My app doesn't look well. And I really like to finish with polish-- to feel proud about what I've built. I'm bummed that I ran out of time to add polish.

This week I also learned a life lesson: sometimes coding/problem solving and regular life stuff are hard to do at the same time. Debugging javascript takes concentration. It's not something I can do well later at night when the kids go to be. So I need to learn how to balance easier day work for later night shift, and use earlier hours to write/debug my javascript.

Next assignment, I'm going to write detailed pseudocode in the javascript file, as my todos. I'm also going to refactor regularly. For every 2 hours or less of code, I will refactor. And I'm clearing out times in each day when the brain is functioning well, to write and debug my code.

It's all about learning! So though my app needs work, I can honestly say I learned a lot, and that's what's important.
