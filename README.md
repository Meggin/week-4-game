# Star Wars RPG

I learned a lot this week! Two main things I learned: pseudocode needs to go down to the lowest possible detail, and it's very important to refactor as you go, not towards the end of the assignment.

Since I didn't do these two things at the start of this project, I wound up with an application that I'm not super excited about. It's buggy. The attack button won't disable fully. I tried many ways to disable it, but I just couldn't figure it out. Refactoring along the way would have made this much easier.

Sometimes the score is a bit off. I suspect it's because a score goes below zero. If I had refactored earlier, I could have tested this properly.

My app doesn't look well. And I really like to finish with polish-- to feel proud about what I've built.

This week I also learned that sometimes life and coding are difficult. Debugging javascript takes concentration, and trying to do this late at night, when I'm tired, and the kids are asleep, doesn't always work. So now I'm trying to juggle my time a bit better-- writing code earlier in the day, so that I can push forward faster.

Next assignment, I'm going to write detailed pseudocode in the javascript file, as my todos. I'm also going to refactor regularly. For every 2 hours or less of code, I will refactor.
