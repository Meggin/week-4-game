# Star Wars RPG

So this is still buggy. I would like to refactor quite a bit more.

Also, the attack button before a new enemy is selected won't disable. I tried hard, but it just breaks stuff.

I've noticed sometimes when a score is between postive and negative, you might not lost correctly. I need to tweak that.

The styles are all over the place, but I ran out of time. Need to get back to my kids.
